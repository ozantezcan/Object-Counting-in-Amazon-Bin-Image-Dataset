## Description
This project is focused on object counting challenge which stated [here](https://github.com/silverbottlep/abid_challenge).
The problem can be defined as counting the number of object in a given image. We used the Amazon Bin Image Dataset which contains images and metadata from bins located in Amazon Fulfillment Center. Details can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ko/public-datasets/amazon-bin-images/). There are approximately 500.000 images in the dataset with varying number of objects. For the counting problem, there are two different difficulties; the moderate task which aims to classify the bins with at most 5 objects, and the hard task which aims to predict the number of objects in any given bin image. Right now, our project is limited to the moderate task, but we are planning to extend our work for the hard task as well.
